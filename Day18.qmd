## Sampling Distributions using Proportions {.font80}


::: cle13

- **Objective:** Understand how the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ estimates the population proportion $p$.
- **Context:** Whether estimating voter preferences, customer behaviors, or biological occurrences, knowing how to infer population characteristics from sample data is crucial.
:::


## Motivation and Real-World Examples {.font80}

::: cle10
- **Voter Preference:** Estimate the proportion of voters in favor of a new bill.
- **Customer Behavior:** Understand the percentage of customers using store credit cards.
- **Conservation Efforts:** Track the fraction of endangered species born in captivity.

- **Task:** In groups of two- three, discuss why it's important to estimate these proportions accurately.
- **Question:** What might be some implications of inaccurate estimates in these scenarios?

> Example 1: (Example 6.5 - Textbook) Suppose we have selected a random sample of $n=36$ observations from a population with mean $\mu=80$ and standard deviation $\sigma=6$.

## Sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$ {.font80}

![](images/hist6.5.png)

## Properties of Sampling Distribution of $\hat{p}$ {.font80}

::: cle13
1. **Mean of $\hat{p}$**
   - The mean equals the population proportion $p$.
   - $\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$.
   $$ E(\hat{p}) = \mu_{\hat{p}} = p $$

2. **Standard Deviation of $\hat{p}$**
   - The variability of $\hat{p}$ decreases as sample size $n$ increases.
   $$ \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} $$
:::


## Central Limit Theorem for $\hat{p}$ {.font80}

::: cle13
- **Approximately Normal:** For large samples, $\hat{p}$'s distribution is nearly normal.
- **Rule of Thumb:**
  - Consider large if $np \geq 15$ and $n(1-p) \geq 15$.
  $$ n \cdot \hat{p} \geq 15 \quad \text{and} \quad n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 15 $$

> Example 2: The soft-drink cups at a certain fast-food restaurant have tickets attached to them. Customers peel off the tickets to see whether they win a prize. The proportion of tickets that are winners is $p=0.25$. A total of $n=70$ people purchase soft drinks between noon and 1:00 p.m. on a certain day. Let $\hat{p}$ be the proportion that win a prize. Find the mean and standard deviation of $\hat{p}$.

> Example 3: According to a Harris poll taken in September 2013, chocolate is the favorite ice cream flavor for $27 \%$ of Americans. If a sample of 100 Americans is taken, what is the probability that the sample proportion of those who prefer chocolate is greater than 0.30?

> Example 4: In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, $51 \%$ of voters voted for Barack Obama. If a sample of 75 voters were polled, would it be unusual if less than $40 \%$ of them had voted for Barack Obama?
