## Introduction to Continuous Probability Distribution {.font80}


::: cle10
::: font80

- A **continuous random variable**, $x$, can take any value within a specified range. It is graphically depicted by a smooth curve known as the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**, $f(x)$.

- **Key Concepts of PDF**:
  - **Probability of an Interval**: The area under the curve between any two points $a$ and $b$ ($a \leq x \leq b$) represents the probability of $x$ falling within that range.
  - **Non-negativity**: $f(x)\geq0$ for all $x$.
  - **Total Probability**: The integral of $f(x)$ across its entire range equals 1, representing the total set of outcomes for $x$.
  - **Endpoint Consideration**: Including endpoints in an interval, like $x=a$ or $x=b$, does not change the computed probability since $P(x=a)=0$ for any particular $a$.

**Function Representation**: $f(x)$ is often referred to as a density function or frequency function.

**Calculating Probabilities**: The probability that $x$ will fall between any two specific values, $a$ and $b$, is given by the area under $f(x)$ between these points.

**Graphical Illustration**: The shape of the distribution varies based on the data it models, reflecting different types of continuous random variables.

**Zero Probability at a Point**: A fundamental property of continuous variables: The probability of $x$ assuming any exact value, such as $a$, is zero, reinforcing that continuous variables span ranges rather than discrete points.

## Introduction to Uniform Distribution

::: {.callout-note title="Definition"}

Uniform distribution, or rectangular distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution where every outcome in a specified range is equally likely.

- **Graphical Representation**: Depicted as a rectangle because the probability density function is constant within the bounds.
- **Basic Formula**: The probability density function (PDF) is $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x$ within the interval $[a, b]$.

- **Area Calculation**: Probabilities are calculated as the area under the PDF curve, simplifying to the width of the interval times the height of the PDF.
- **Example**: For an interval $[a, b]$, the probability that $x$ falls within $[c, d]$ (where $c$ and $d$ are within $a$ and $b$) is $(d-c) \times \frac{1}{b-a}$.

## Statistical Measures

<br>

::: font80
::: cle13

- **Mean and Median**: The mean, $\mu$, and median of a uniform distribution are the same, given by $\mu = \frac{c+d}{2}$.
- **Variance**: The variance, $\sigma^2$, is calculated as $\sigma = \frac{(d-c)^2}{12}$.

:::

## Real-World Applications

<br>

::: font80
::: cle15

- **Uniformity**: Ideal for modelling scenarios where each outcome within a range is equally likely, such as random draws from a finite set or simulation inputs.
- **Examples**: Used in simulations, randomized algorithms, and systems modeling where equal likelihood is assumed for inputs or scenarios within a certain range.

> Example 1: Example 1 An unprincipled used-car dealer sells a car to an unsuspecting buyer, even though the dealer knows that the car will have a major breakdown within the next 6 months. The dealer provides a warranty of 45 days on all cars sold. Let $x$ represent the length of time until the breakdown occurs. Assume that x is a uniform random variable with values between 0 and 6 months.

a. Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation of $X$.

b. Graph the probability distribution of $X$ , and show the mean on the horizontal axis. Also show oneand two-standard-deviation intervals around the mean.

c. Calculate the probability that the breakdown occurs while the car is still under warranty.
