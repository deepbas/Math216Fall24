This rule uses conditional probabilities.\n\n$$P(B|A)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)} \\Rightarrow P(A\\cap B)=P(A)\\cdot P(B|A)$$\n\n- The rule helps in understanding how the occurrence of event $A$ influences the probability of event $B$.\n\n$$P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)} \\Rightarrow P(A\\cap B)=P(B)\\cdot P(A|B)$$\n\nGiven $P(A)$ and $P(B|A)$, you can find $P(A\\cap B)$.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Multiplicative Rule of Probability\n\n::: cle7\n::: font70\n\n- The multiplicative rule determines the probability of the intersection of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n- It is calculated in two ways, depending on which event's probability is conditioned on the other.\n\n$$P(A\\cap B)=P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)$$\n$$P(A\\cap B)=P(B) \\cdot P(A|B)$$\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Law of Total Probability\n\n::: cle8\n::: font70\n\n- The law of total probability allows the calculation of the probability of an event based on exhaustive, mutually exclusive scenarios.\n- It divides the sample space into parts \\($B$\\) and \\($B^c$\\) (the complement of \\($B$\\)).\n\n$$P(A)=P(B) \\cdot P(A|B)+P\\left(B^c\\right) \\cdot P\\left(A|B^c\\right)$$\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##  \n\n::: font60\n> Example 1: Suppose that two balls are to be selected at random, without replacement, from a box containing $r$ red balls and $b$ blue balls.

What is the probability that the second ball will be blue?\n:::\n\n\n## Independence in Probability\n\n::: cle9\n::: font70\nKnowing that event $B$ has occurred may or may not alter the probability of event $A$.\n\n- **Independence**: Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurrence of $B$ does not change the probability of $A$.\n\n$$P(A|B)=P(A)$$\n\n- **Reciprocal Independence**: If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then the occurrence of $A$ also does not affect the probability of $B$.\n\n$$P(B|A)=P(B)$$\n\nEvents not satisfying these conditions are dependent, meaning the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.\n\n:::\n:::\n## \n\n::: font60\n> Example 2 Consider the experiment of tossing a fair die, and let\n$$A= \\{\\text{Observe an even number.}\\}$$\n$$B= \\{\\text{Observe a number less than or equal to 4.}\\}$$\nAre $A$ and $B$ independent events?\n:::\n\n\n## Key Points on Independence\n\n::: cle10\n::: font70\n\n- **Independence vs. Intuition**: Independence cannot be inferred visually through a Venn diagramâ€”only through precise probability calculations.\n  \n- **Mutual Exclusivity and Dependence**: Mutually exclusive events with nonzero probabilities (e.g., $A$ and $B$) are dependent because the occurrence of one precludes the occurrence of the other.\n  \n  $$P(A|B)=0$$\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Intersection Probability Rule\n\n::: cle11\n::: font70\n\n- **Independence**: Independence means $P(B|A)=P(B)$.\n\n- **Intersection Rule**: For independent events $A$ and $B$:\n\n  $$P(A\\cap B)=P(A) \\cdot P(B)$$\n\n- **Converse Validity**: If the intersection probability holds:\n\n  $$\\text{If } P(A\\cap B)=P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\text{ then } A \\& B \\text{ are independent.}$$\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n::: font70\n\n> Example 3: The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) found that $25 \\%$ of divorced couples are classified as \"fiery foes\" (i.e., they communicate through their children and are hostile toward each other).\n\na.

Suppose there is a medical test for this disease. If a person has the disease, there is a probability of $r_2$ that the test will give a positive response. If a person does not have the disease, there is a probability of $r_3$ that the test will give a positive response. Suppose you take the test. What is the probability that you get a positive response but in fact, you do not have the disease? Derive the formula, then compute the results for the following sets of values of paameters.\n\n1. $r_1=0.0001, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$\n2. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$\n3. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.9999, r_3=0.0001$\n\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n::: font50\n\n> Example 5: (Test for a Disease 2) Consider the previous example with $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$ If you take the test and get a positive response.
