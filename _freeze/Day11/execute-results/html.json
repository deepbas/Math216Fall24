It is graphically depicted by a smooth curve known as the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**, $f(x)$.\n\n- **Key Concepts of PDF**:\n  - **Probability of an Interval**: The area under the curve between any two points $a$ and $b$ ($a \\leq x \\leq b$) represents the probability of $x$ falling within that range.\n  - **Non-negativity**: $f(x)\\geq0$ for all $x$.\n  - **Total Probability**: The integral of $f(x)$ across its entire range equals 1, representing the total set of outcomes for $x$.\n  - **Endpoint Consideration**: Including endpoints in an interval, like $x=a$ or $x=b$, does not change the computed probability since $P(x=a)=0$ for any particular $a$.\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Properties and Visualization of Continuous Distributions {.font70}\n\n::: row\n::: left\n\n![](images/continuous_pdf.png)\n\n:::\n\n\n::: right\n\n::: font80\n::: cle6\n\n**Function Representation**: $f(x)$ is often referred to as a density function or frequency function.\n\n**Calculating Probabilities**: The probability that $x$ will fall between any two specific values, $a$ and $b$, is given by the area under $f(x)$ between these points.\n\n**Graphical Illustration**: The shape of the distribution varies based on the data it models, reflecting different types of continuous random variables.\n\n**Zero Probability at a Point**: A fundamental property of continuous variables: The probability of $x$ assuming any exact value, such as $a$, is zero, reinforcing that continuous variables span ranges rather than discrete points.\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Introduction to Uniform Distribution\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Definition\"}\n\nUniform distribution, or rectangular distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution where every outcome in a specified range is equally likely.\n\n- **Graphical Representation**: Depicted as a rectangle because the probability density function is constant within the bounds.\n- **Basic Formula**: The probability density function (PDF) is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x$ within the interval $[a, b]$.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualizing and Calculating Probabilities {.font80}\n\n::: row\n::: left\n\n![](images/uniform_pdf.png)\n\n:::\n\n\n::: right\n\n\n::: cle11\n::: font90\n\n- **Area Calculation**: Probabilities are calculated as the area under the PDF curve, simplifying to the width of the interval times the height of the PDF.\n- **Example**: For an interval $[a, b]$, the probability that $x$ falls within $[c, d]$ (where $c$ and $d$ are within $a$ and $b$) is $(d-c) \\times \\frac{1}{b-a}$.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Statistical Measures\n\n<br>\n\n::: font80\n::: cle13\n\n- **Mean and Median**: The mean, $\\mu$, and median of a uniform distribution are the same, given by $\\mu = \\frac{c+d}{2}$.\n- **Variance**: The variance, $\\sigma^2$, is calculated as $\\sigma = \\frac{(d-c)^2}{12}$.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\n<br>\n\n::: font80\n::: cle15\n\n- **Uniformity**: Ideal for modelling scenarios where each outcome within a range is equally likely, such as random draws from a finite set or simulation inputs.\n- **Examples**: Used in simulations, randomized algorithms, and systems modeling where equal likelihood is assumed for inputs or scenarios within a certain range.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## \n\n::: font60\n\n> Example 1: Example 1 An unprincipled used-car dealer sells a car to an unsuspecting buyer, even though the dealer knows that the car will have a major breakdown within the next 6 months. The dealer provides a warranty of 45 days on all cars sold. Let $x$ represent the length of time until the breakdown occurs. Assume that x is a uniform random variable with values between 0 and 6 months.\n\na. Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation of $X$.\n\n:::\n\n##\n\n::: font60\n\nb. Graph the probability distribution of $X$ , and show the mean on the horizontal axis. Also show oneand two-standard-deviation intervals around the mean.\n\n::: custom-space\n:::\n\nc. Calculate the probability that the breakdown occurs while the car is still under warranty.\n\n:::\n\n",
