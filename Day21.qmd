## Sampling Distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}$ {.font80}

::: cle6

1. **Mean of Sampling Distribution**: $\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$, i.e., the mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is $p$.
2. **Standard Deviation**: $\sigma_p=\sqrt{\frac{p q}{n}}$, where $q=1-p$.
3. **Approximation to Normality**: For large samples, the distribution of $\hat{p}$ is approximately normal, valid if $n \hat{p} \geq 15$ and $n \hat{q} \geq 15$.

## Large-Sample Confidence Interval for $p$ {.font80}

::: cle7
- Formula: $\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}$
- $\hat{p}=\frac{x}{n}$, $\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}$
- Assumes $n$ is large enough for normal approximation.

## Conditions for Valid Large-Sample C.I. for $\boldsymbol{p}$ {.font80}

::: cle8
1. Random sample from the target population.
2. Large sample size, quantified by $n \hat{p} \geq 15$ and $n \hat{q} \geq 15$.

> Example 1: A study involved a random sample of 169 individuals, which resulted in a sample proportion ($\hat{p}$) of 0.65. Evaluate if the sample size is large enough to construct a confidence interval for the population proportion $p$ using the provided methods, construct a 90% confidence interval for $p$, and identify the necessary assumption to ensure the validity of this confidence interval.

## Recall Example 1 from Day 19 Slides {.font50}

> Consider a large hospital that wants to estimate the average length of stay of its patients, $\mu$ . The hospital randomly samples $n=100$ of its patients and finds that the sample mean length of stay is $\bar{x}=4.5$ days. Also, suppose it is known that the standard deviation of the length of stay for all hospital patients is $\sigma=4$ days.

Initial 95\% C.I.: $4.5 \pm 0.78$ days; width $=1.56$ days.

**Adjusting Sample Size for Precision** 

::: cle10
- Goal: Narrow C.I. width from 1.56 days to 0.50 day.
- Calculation leads to a required sample size of approximately ____ patients.

## Recap: Confidence Intervals {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Confidence Interval (C.I.)**: Gauge of estimate reliability.
- **Sampling Error (SE)**: The permissible error in the estimate, half the width of the C.I.

:::

## Practical Considerations and Misconceptions {.font80}

::: cle12
1. C.I. is not a probability measure for $\mu$ lying within certain bounds.
2. Correctly, a 99% C.I. covers the true mean in 99% of such experiments.
3. C.I. for population mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, not sample mean $\overline{\boldsymbol{x}}$.
4. Express confidence in C.I.: "We are $xx\%$ confident that $\mu$ falls within the C.I."
5. Avoid stating "the probability that $\mu$ is within the C.I. is $xx\%$."
:::


## {.font60}


> Example 2: Building on the information and context from Example 1, design a study where the goal is to calculate the required sample size to achieve a narrower margin of error for the population proportion $p$. Assume a desired sampling error of 0.03 at a $90 \%$ confidence level, maintaining the same population proportion estimate $(\hat{p}=0.65)$. How many individuals should be included in the new sample to meet these precision requirements? If you did not know $p$ in advance, how would you estimate the sample size in advance for the same sampling error?
