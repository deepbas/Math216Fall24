## The Multiplicative Rule

::: cle3
::: font70

- The probability of the intersection of two events, $A$ and $B$, can be calculated using the multiplicative rule. This rule uses conditional probabilities.

$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)} \Rightarrow P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B|A)$$

- The rule helps in understanding how the occurrence of event $A$ influences the probability of event $B$.

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \Rightarrow P(A\cap B)=P(B)\cdot P(A|B)$$

Given $P(A)$ and $P(B|A)$, you can find $P(A\cap B)$.

## Multiplicative Rule of Probability

::: cle
::: font70

- The multiplicative rule determines the probability of the intersection of two events \(A\) and \(B\).
- It is calculated in two ways, depending on which event's probability is conditioned on the other.

$$P(A\cap B)=P(A) \cdot P(B|A)$$
$$P(A\cap B)=P(B) \cdot P(A|B)$$

## Law of Total Probability

::: cle
::: font70

- The law of total probability allows the calculation of the probability of an event based on exhaustive, mutually exclusive scenarios.
- It divides the sample space into parts \(B\) and \($B^c$\) (the complement of \(B\)).

$$P(A)=P(B) \cdot P(A|B)+P\left(B^c\right) \cdot P\left(A|B^c\right)$$

> Example 1: Suppose that two balls are to be selected at random, without replacement, from a box containing $r$ red balls and $b$ blue balls. What is the probability that the first ball will be red and the second ball will be blue? What is the probability that the second ball will be blue?
:::


## Independence in Probability

::: cle
::: font70
Knowing that event $B$ has occurred may or may not alter the probability of event $A$.

- **Independence**: Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurrence of $B$ does not change the probability of $A$.

$$P(A|B)=P(A)$$

- **Reciprocal Independence**: If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then the occurrence of $A$ also does not affect the probability of $B$.

$$P(B|A)=P(B)$$

Events not satisfying these conditions are dependent, meaning the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.

> Example 2 Consider the experiment of tossing a fair die, and let
$$A= \{\text{Observe an even number.}\}$$
$$B= \{\text{Observe a number less than or equal to 4.}\}$$
Are $A$ and $B$ independent events?
:::


## Key Points on Independence

::: cle4
::: font70

- **Independence vs. Intuition**: Independence cannot be inferred visually through a Venn diagramâ€”only through precise probability calculations.
  
- **Mutual Exclusivity and Dependence**: Mutually exclusive events with nonzero probabilities (e.g., $A$ and $B$) are dependent because the occurrence of one precludes the occurrence of the other.
  
  $$P(A|B)=0$$

:::
:::

## Intersection Probability Rule

::: cle4
::: font70

- **Independence**: Independence means $P(B|A)=P(B)$.

- **Intersection Rule**: For independent events $A$ and $B$:

  $$P(A\cap B)=P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

- **Converse Validity**: If the intersection probability holds:

  $$\text{If } P(A\cap B)=P(A) \cdot P(B) \text{ then } A \& B \text{ are independent.}$$

> Example 3: The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) found that $25 \%$ of divorced couples are classified as "fiery foes" (i.e., they communicate through their children and are hostile toward each other).

a. What is the probability that in a sample of 2 divorced couples, both are classified as "fiery foes"?

b. What is the probability that in a sample of 10 divorced couples, all 10 are classified as "fiery foes"?

## Bayes's Rule and Its Foundation

::: cle1
::: font60

- **Recall Multiplicative Rule**:

  $$P(A \cap B)=P(A) P(B | A)$$
  $$P(A \cap B)=P(B) P(A | B)$$
  $$P(A) P(B | A)=P(B) P(A | B)$$

- **Deriving Bayes's Rule**:

  Divide the multiplicative identity by $P(B)$:

  $$P(A | B)=\frac{P(A) P(B | A)}{P(B)}$$
  
  Incorporating the Law of Total Probability:

  $$P(A | B)=\frac{P(A) P(B | A)}{P(A) P(B | A)+P\left(A^c\right) P\left(B | A^c\right)}$$

## Bayes Rule Example

::: ws
::: font70

- **Scenario**: Estimating the likelihood of liver disease in a patient who is an alcoholic.
- **Define Events**:
  - $A$: Patient has liver disease.
  - $B$: Patient is an alcoholic.
- **Probabilities**:
  - $P(A) = 0.10$ (10% of patients have liver disease)
  - $P(B) = 0.05$ (5% of patients are alcoholics)

:::
:::

## Application of Bayes's Rule

::: fsp
::: font70

- **Given**: You need to find $P(A | B)$, the probability of liver disease if the patient is an alcoholic.
- **Available Data**: $P(B | A) = 0.07$ (7% of those with liver disease are alcoholics)
- **Bayes's Rule Calculation**:
  
  $$P(A | B) = P(A) \cdot \frac{P(B | A)}{P(B)} = 0.10 \cdot \frac{0.07}{0.05} = 0.14$$

- **Interpretation**: A patient who is an alcoholic has a 14% chance of having liver disease, higher than the general clinic population.

> Example 4: (Test for a Disease) Consider a certain disease that the chance of a randomly selected individual having this disease is $r_1$ (this can be estimated from the historical data). Suppose there is a medical test for this disease. If a person has the disease, there is a probability of $r_2$ that the test will give a positive response. If a person does not have the disease, there is a probability of $r_3$ that the test will give a positive response. Suppose you take the test. What is the probability that you get a positive response but in fact, you do not have the disease? Derive the formula, then compute the results for the following sets of values of paameters.

1. $r_1=0.0001, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$
2. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$
3. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.9999, r_3=0.0001$

> Example 5: (Test for a Disease 2) Consider the previous example with $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$ If you take the test and get a positive response. You believe the result is not accurate, and test again and still get a positive response, what is the probability that in fact you do not have the disease?
