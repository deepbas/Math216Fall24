# Descriptive Statistics

::: bqt
- In order to make sense of data, we need ways to **summarize and visualize** it
- Summarizing and visualizing variables and relationships between two variables is often known as **descriptive statistics**, also known as **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- The type of summary statistics and visualization methods depend on the type of variable(s) being analyzed (qualitative or quantitative)

::: green-h
A random sample of US adults in 2012 were surveyed regarding the type of cell phone owned

## Frequency Table

::: font70

A frequency table shows the number of cases or counts that fall
in each category:

::: row
::: left

::: table-colored

| Subset of Raw Data | Device Type             |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Case 1             | Android                 |
| Case 2             | none                    |
| Case 3             | none                    |
| Case 4             | iPhone                  |
| Case 5             | Non Smartphone          |
| Case 6             | iPhone                  |
| Case 7             | Blackberry              |
| Case 8             | Non Smartphone          |
| Case 9             | Android                 |
| Case 10            | Android                 |
| ...                | (for 2253 cases ...)    |

 Cell Phone Type  | Frequency

## Proportion

The proportion in a category is found by $$\text{proportion} = \frac{\text{number in category}}{\text{total sample size}}$$




::: lqt
Percentages/proportions  (relative frequencies)

- $p$ = proportion for a [population (parameter)]{.bold-red}
- $\hat{p}$ = proportion for a [sample (statistic) ("p-hat")]{.bold-red}
:::


## What proportion of adults sampled do not own a cell phone?

::: table-colored

Cell Phone Type  | Frequency | Proportion
------------- | ------------- | -----------
Android  | 458 | 0.203
iPhone  | 437 | 0.194
Blackberry | 141 | 0.063
Non Smartphone | 924 | 0.41
No Cell Phone | 293 | 0.13
Total | 2253 | 1.000

:::

Proportions and percentages can be used interchangeably



## Bar Chart/Plot/Graph

In a barplot, the height of the bar corresponds to the number of cases falling in each category




```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(cell_phone_data, aes(x = Type, y = Frequency)) +
  geom_col(fill = c("darkblue", "red", "green", "orange", "purple")) +
  labs(x = "Cell Phone Type", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Cell Phone Usage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
```



## Two qualitative Variables

Look at the relationship between two qualitative variables
- Relationship status
- Gender

::: table-colored
|  | Female | Male | Total |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| In a Relationship | 32 | 10 | 42 |
| It's Complicated | 12 | 7 | 19 |
| Single | 63 | 45 | 108 |
| Total | 107 | 62 | 169 |
:::

We add a second dimension to a frequency table to account for the second qualitative variable




## Relationship status and Gender

::: eqt

Proportion of students in a relationship that are female?

```{r}
prop.relation.female <- 32/42
round(prop.relation.female,2)
```

<br>

Proportion of students in a relationship that are male?

```{r}
prop.relation.male <- 10/42
round(prop.relation.male,2)
```

:::




## Relationship status and Gender

::: eqt
Proportion of males that are in a relationship?

```{r}
prop.male <- 10/62
round(prop.male,2) 
```

Proportion of females that are in a relationship?

```{r}
prop.female <- 32/107
round(prop.female,2)
```

## Difference in proportions

::: bql
::: font80

A difference in proportions is a difference in proportions for one qualitative variable calculated for different levels of the other qualitative variable

 - Example: Difference in proportions of male and female that are in a relationship:

$$
\begin{align*}
 \hat{p}_F - \hat{p}_M = \frac{32}{107} - \frac{10}{62} = 0.14
\end{align*}
$$




```{r}
# R-code
prop.female <- 32/107
prop.male <- 10/62
prop.diff <- prop.female - prop.male
round(prop.diff,2) 
```

## Student Survey

Dataset on 362 responses to a student survey given at one college


::: font50

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(survey |> select(-c(4,5,6, 13,14, 15, 18)),10))
```

:::



# Distribution

> In the given dataset, there are multiple variables (such as Gender, Smoke, Exercise, Height, Weight, etc.) for different students across various academic years.


Knowing the distribution of each variable can help us identify relationships, trends, and potential anomalies in the data.




::: middle-align-xy


## Distribution 

<br>

::: green-h
"The distribution of the variable Y"

- describes its center, variability and shape
- use both numbers and graphics
:::

:::


## Center: Mean or Average

::: bqt
Mean: average value in a sample or population

- $\bar{y} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}$ is an average of $n$ values $y_i$ in a sample
- $\mu$ is an average value of $y$ in a population

:::


## Student Survey 

::: eqt

```{r}
survey <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/StudentSurvey.csv")
mean(survey$Pulse) # the command `mean` computes an average
```
:::

::: green-h
The mean pulse rate for this sample of students is $\bar{y} = 69.6$ beats per minute.
:::




## Center: Median

::: bql
Median: the middle value when the data are ordered

- The median splits the data in half
- $m$ is the median value in a sample
- $M$ is the median value in a population

:::

```{r}
median(survey$Pulse) # the command `median` computes an median
```

::: green-h
The median pulse rate for this sample of students is $m = 70$ beats per minute. 
:::



## Variability: Standard Deviation

::: bq

Standard Devation (SD): average deviation from center in a sample or population

- $s = \sqrt{ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \overline{y})^2}{n-1}}$ is the SD of $n$ values $y_i$ in a sample
- $\sigma$ is the SD of values of $y$ in a population
:::

```{r}
sd(survey$Pulse) # the command `sd` computes an average
```

::: green-h
The SD of pulse rates for this sample of students is $s = 12.2$ beats per minute. The "average" deviation of individual pulse rates around the mean value is about 12.2 beats per minute.
