## Challenges with Non-normal Distributions {.font70}

::: cle9

What if the population data is decidedly nonnormal?

**Nonnormal Distributions**

- Small sample sizes ($n<30$) and nonnormal data can undermine the reliability of typical tests like t-tests.
- This often leads to increased Type I errors: rejecting $H_0$ when it is true.

**Nonparametric Statistics**

- Nonparametric tests do not assume a normal distribution of the sampled population.
- They rely on the ranks of measurements, such as the median, which are less sensitive to extreme values.

## Nonparametric Sign Test {.font80}

::: cle10

- The sign test offers a straightforward method to test hypotheses about the median of a nonnormal distribution.
- It focuses on the median rather than the mean, providing a more robust measure of central tendency.

## How It Works {.font80}

::: cle4

Begin with the null hypothesis that the median is at a specific value ($\eta_0$). Classify each observation in the sample as either above or below this median value.

- Assume $H_0: \eta = \eta_0$ is true.
- Count the number of sample observations above ($S_A$) and below ($S_B$) the median $\eta_0$.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# R Code to perform Sign Test
library(BSDA)
SIGN.test(x = data, md = eta_0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)
```

:::

## Decision Making in Sign Test {.font80}

::: cle4

**Decision Rule**

- Reject $H_0$ if the p-value is less than the significance level $\alpha$.
- The p-value is computed using the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (total number of non-zero differences) and $p=0.5$ (probability under the null hypothesis).

> Example 1: Increasing numbers of both private and public agencies are requiring their employees to submit to tests for substance abuse. One laboratory that conducts such testing has developed a system with a normalized measurement scale in which values less than 1.00 indicate "normal" ranges and values equal to or greater than 1.00 are indicative of potential substance abuse. The lab reports a normal result as long as the median level for an individual is less than 1.00. Eight independent measurements of each individual's sample are made. One individual's results are shown in the following table. Determine whether the population median is less than 1.00 . Use $\alpha=0.05$.

Before and after quiz scores for 10 students:

| Student | Before Study Session (Score) | After Study Session (Score) |
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1       | 70                           | 75                         |

### Activity Steps

1. **Calculate the Differences**: Students calculate the difference for each pair of scores (After - Before).
2. **Assign Signs**: Assign a plus (+) if the difference is positive (score increased) and a minus (-) if negative (score decreased).
3. **Count Signs**: Count the total number of positive and negative signs.
