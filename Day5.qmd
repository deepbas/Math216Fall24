## Introduction to Probability


::: cle6
::: font90

- **Experiment**: Any act of observation with uncertain outcomes (e.g., Tossing a coin).
- **Observation**: The result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).

Mathematical Representation

- Let $E$ represent an experiment.
- An outcome of $E$ is an element of the sample space $S$.
- Probability of an event $A$ is denoted by $P(A)$.

## Definitions

::: cle15
::: font80

### Sample Point
- **Definition**: The most basic outcome of an experiment.
- **In Coin Toss**: Each toss that results in H or T.

### Sample Space
- **Definition**: Collection of all possible outcomes (sample points) of an experiment.
- **In Coin Toss**: {H, T}

## Venn Diagram

::: font60

- **Sample Space (S)**: Represented as a closed figure in the diagram.
- **Sample Points**: Each possible outcome shown as a solid dot within the figure.


Example: Coin Toss

- **Venn Diagram**: Circle labeled S containing two points labeled H (Head) and T (Tail).
- **Representation**: Helps visualize all possible outcomes in a single view.

## Experiments and Their Sample Spaces

::: cle11
::: font40

Experiment: Tossing a Coin

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$\begin{align*}
  S &= \{e \mid e \text{ is the up face of a coin}\} \\
  &= \{H, T\} \text{ (Head or Tail)}
  \end{align*}$$

Experiment: Rolling a Die

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$\begin{align*}
  S &= \{e \mid e \text{ is the up face of a die}\} \\
  &= \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \text{ (Numbers on the die)}
  \end{align*}$$

Experiment: Tossing Two Coins

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$\begin{align*}
  S &= \{e \mid e \text{ is the combination of faces of two coins}\} \\
  &= \{HH, HT, TH, TT\} \text{ (All possible combinations)}
  \end{align*}$$

## Defining Probability

::: cle14
::: font70

**Probability of a Sample Point**: Number between 0 and 1 indicating likelihood of the outcome.


Rule 1: Range of Probabilities

- Each probability $p_i$ must be:
  $0 \leq p_i \leq 1$

Rule 2: Sum of Probabilities

- Total probability across all sample points:
  $\sum_{\text{all } i} p_i = 1$
- Ensures completeness of the sample space.

## Example: Calculating Winning Probability in a Dice Game

::: cle13
::: font50

::: row
::: left

- **Experiment**: Tossing a fair die.
- **Winning Condition**: If the up face is an even number (2, 4, 6), you win $1.
- **Losing Condition**: If the up face is odd (1, 3, 5), you lose $1.

Sample Space and Probabilities

- **Sample Space (S)**:
  $$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$
- **Uniform Probabilities**:
  $$p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \cdots = p_6 = \frac{1}{6}$$


:::

::: right

Calculation of Winning Probability

- **Event of Winning**:
  $$\text{Winning } = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
- **Probability of Winning**:
  $$\text{Prob of Winning } = p_2 + p_4 + p_6 = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

## Event Definition 

::: cle3

Definition of an Event

- **Event (A)**: A collection of sample points.

Probability of an Event

- **Calculation**: Sum of probabilities of all sample points in the event.

:::


## Steps for Calculating Event Probabilities

::: cle4
::: font60
::: row
::: left

1. **Define the Experiment**: Describe the observation process.
2. **List Sample Points**: Identify possible outcomes.
3. **Assign Probabilities**: Allocate probability to each sample point.
4. **Identify Event's Sample Points**: Determine which sample points are part of the event.
5. **Calculate Event Probability**: Sum the probabilities of the event's sample points.

:::

::: right

Example

- **Experiment**: Tossing a coin twice.
- **Sample Points**: {HH, HT, TH, TT}
- **Event**: Getting at least one head.
- **Calculation**: Probability(HH) + Probability(HT) + Probability(TH)

## Compound Events: Unions 

::: cle8

Unions

- **Definition**: Union of two events $A$ and $B$ ($A \cup B$)
- **Occurs If**: Either event $A$, event $B$, or both happen.
- **Composition**: Includes all sample points in $A$, $B$, or both.
  $$A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$$

:::

## Compound Events: Intersections

::: cle9

Intersections

- **Definition**: Intersection of two events $A$ and $B$ ($A \cap B$)
- **Occurs If**: Both event $A$ and event $B$ happen.
- **Composition**: Includes all sample points that are in both $A$ and $B$.
  $$A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$$
:::


## Example: Calculating Unions and Intersections in a Die-Toss

::: font40
::: cle10

::: row
::: left

- **Event A**: Toss an even number.
  $$A = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
- **Event B**: Toss a number less than or equal to 3.
  $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$
- **Sample Space (S)**:
  $$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$

:::

::: right

Union and Intersection

- **Union ($A \cup B$)**: Any number less than 6.
  $$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}$$
- **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: Only number both even and â‰¤ 3.
  $$A \cap B = \{2\}$$

:::
:::

Probability Calculations

- **Probability of Union ($P(A \cup B)$)**:
  $$P(A \cup B) = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 + P_6 = \frac{5}{6}$$
- **Probability of Intersection ($P(A \cap B)$)**:
  $$P(A \cap B) = P_2 = \frac{1}{6}$$


:::

## Calculating Sample Points Using Combinations

::: cle8
::: font60

- **Combinations Rule**: Calculate the number of possible samples drawn without replacement.
- **Formula**:
  $\binom{N}{n} = \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}$
  where $N$ is the total number of elements, and $n$ is the number of elements per sample.

Factorial Explained

- **Notation**: $n!$ (factorial of $n$)
- **Definition**: Product of all positive integers up to $n$.
  $$n! = n \times (n-1) \times \dots \times 1$$
- **Example**: $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$

## Your Odds in the Pick-6 Lotto

::: cle
::: font70
In Florida's Pick-6 Lotto, you select six numbers from a set ranging from 1 to 53, aiming to match all to win.

- **Total Combinations**:
  $$\binom{53}{6} = \frac{53!}{6!(53-6)!} = \frac{53 \times 52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49 \times 48}{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 22,957,480$$
- **Probability of Winning**:
  $$P = \frac{1}{22,957,480}$$
